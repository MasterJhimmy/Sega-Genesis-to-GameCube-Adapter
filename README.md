# Sega Genesis/Mega Drive to GameCube Adapter

Simple use of NicoHood's "Nintendo" library in conjuction with jonthysell's "SegaController" library, allowing the use of Sega Genesis/Mega Drive controllers on GameCube/Wii hardware.

## Requirements

- [NicoHood's Nintendo library](https://github.com/NicoHood/Nintendo)
- [jonthysell's SegaController library](https://github.com/jonthysell/SegaController)
- Arduino Nano (or any 5V 16MHz Arduino, Atmega168 or Atmega328, just adapting the pin numbers)
- Bidirectional Logic Level Converter (5V to 3.3V)
- Male DB9 connector
- 1kÎ© Resistor
- GameCube Controller Extension Cord

## Hardware

First, cut the female end of the extension cord, using a multimeter in continuity mode to check which wire corresponds to which pin in the male end. In my case I used a male and female DB9 connectors as a breakout, to use the same extension cord in multiple adapters, but you can solder the wires directly without the breakout.

## Software

After installing both libraries into your Arduino IDE (both of their pages have instructions in how to do so), upload the code to your Arduino.

Huge thanks to [NicoHood](https://github.com/NicoHood/) and [jonthysell](https://github.com/jonthysell/) for both their amazing libraries.

Also, thanks to [tevey](https://github.com/tevey) for his [SNES to GameCube adapter](https://github.com/tevey/snesToGameCube), which not only inspired me to make this project, but taught me a great deal in how to use the "Nintendo" library correctly.
